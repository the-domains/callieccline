hi, my name is callie cline and i joined second life about 10 years ago. i didn't know much about it when i joined. never did i think i'd be in this virtual space for ten years. 

my adventures in second life have been as diverse as the those that inhabit the space. from fun to frightening, it's hard to even put it into word. what is "fake" is more real that "real life" itself at times. and is there any difference? not really. but, more about that later!
